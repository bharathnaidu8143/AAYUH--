We were able to design and develop AAYUH, a web-based health and emergency assistance platform aimed at improving public health awareness and reducing response time during medical and road emergencies. The project covers the complete web development lifecycle, from ideation and requirement analysis to implementation, testing, and deployment. AAYUH provides features such as medicine and disease information, symptom checking, secure user authentication, medical history storage, and an emergency contact system for quick assistance during critical situations. The application uses modern technologies including React.js for the frontend and Firebase, Node.js, Express, and PostgreSQL for backend services and data management. By integrating public health APIs and secure authentication mechanisms, the platform avoids manual data maintenance while ensuring reliability and scalability. This project significantly enhanced our understanding of full-stack development, system design, and real-world problem-solving, and the experience gained will be valuable for future academic and professional endeavors.
